# Extended-Euclidean-algorithm
This console application generate table for extended Euclidean algorithm.
Also this algoritm can calculate the greatest common divisor.
In arithmetic and computer programming, the extended Euclidean algorithm is an extension to the Euclidean algorithm, and computes, in addition to the greatest common divisor (gcd) of integers a and b, also the coefficients of Bézout's identity, which are integers x and y such that.

First row contains the remainder of dividing our two numbers.
For example 27(mod5)=2, 5(mod2)=1, 2(mod1).
The penultimate value of this line is our greatest common divisor (1).
Еhe second row contains integer parts of the divisors of the previous row.
For example 27/5=5, 5/2=2 and so on.

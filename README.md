# Extended-Euclidean-algorithm
This console application generate table for extended Euclidean algorithm.

Also this algoritm can calculate the greatest common divisor.

In arithmetic and computer programming, the extended Euclidean algorithm is an extension to the Euclidean algorithm, and computes, in addition to the greatest common divisor (gcd) of integers a and b, also the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity, which are integers u and v such that.
